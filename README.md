## 📜 Project Descriptions  

### 1. **Netflix Data Analysis**  
- **Goal:** Analyze Netflix datasets to explore viewing trends, popular genres, and content distribution.  
- **Key Skills:**  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
  - Insights on movie/show trends  

---

### 2. **Rule-Based Bot (AI Project)**  
- **Goal:** Develop a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user queries using predefined rules.  
- **Key Skills:**  
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) basics  
  - Regular expressions and pattern matching  
  - Rule-based AI systems  

---

### 3. **Spam Email Classifier**  
- **Goal:** Build a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam.  
- **Key Skills:**  
  - Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)  
  - Feature extraction using TF-IDF  
  - Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes)  
  - Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

### 4. **User Ad Click Prediction**  
- **Goal:** Predict whether a user will click on an ad based on demographic and behavioral data.  
- **Key Skills:**  
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
  - Logistic Regression and other classification models  
  - Model evaluation metrics (AUC, ROC, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started  

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manvichaturvedi/Data_Science_Projects.git
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required libraries with:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(You can create a requirements.txt listing all dependencies.)

Run the Notebooks:
Open Jupyter Notebook and run any .ipynb file.

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
📈 Future Improvements
Add more data science projects and case studies.

Include datasets or links to datasets used.

Create detailed markdown documentation within each notebook.
